#In this analysis of the Titanic dataset, I uncovered valuable insights into what influenced passenger survival. 
#By cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data, I identified key factors like passenger class, gender, age, and fare that played a significant role in survival outcomes. 
#The findings show that women, younger passengers, and those from higher socio-economic classes had better chances of survival. 
#This project highlights how data can reveal meaningful patterns and relationships, helping us understand historical events more deeply. 
#Overall, this analysis illustrates the full data analytics workflow—from preparation and visualization to drawing insights—demonstrating my skills in data exploration and interpretation.
